        <h1><b>Chest workout</b></h1>
        <p>When doing your actual chest workout, there are a few important things to keep in mind to have the safest and most effective session possible.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p>
            First, always make sure to warm up beforehand so that you don’t jump in with tight, cold muscles. Properly warming up and lengthening your muscles can help improve your performance and reduce the risk of injury in your workout. (Here’s an easy upper-body warm-up you can try.) <br>

            Williams also suggests rolling or stretching out your pec minor before and after the workout. The pec minor in particular tends to get tight after chest strength work and as a result of poor posture, he says. You can help relieve some tightness by facing a wall (a doorway works particularly well), placing a lacrosse ball (or other similarly sized hard ball) on the pec minor (which is located underneath the shoulder on the front of the body, close to the armpit) and then pressing the ball against the wall to massage and lengthen the tissue. <br>
            
            During your chest workouts, no matter what chest exercise you’re doing, make sure that your shoulder blades are pulled down and back. This positioning will help activate your chest muscles and protect your shoulders, Williams says. Also, if you do chest exercises and feel too much tension in your shoulders, take a moment to either readjust your form or change the weight you’re using so that the tension redirects to your chest. Need some extra help activating your chest muscles? Try squeezing your pec muscles and abducting your arms (move them out to the sides away from your body), Williams says.

            A 3-Move Routine to Help Build Push-Up Strength</h5>
          <p>
            <ul>
                Let’s face it: Push-ups are hard. If you don’t yet have the chest strength to pull off this classic bodyweight move, this simple-yet-effective workout can help. <br>

                Created by ACE-certified personal trainer Sivan Fagan, owner of Strong With Sivan in Baltimore, this no-equipment routine targets the pec muscles and your triceps (the muscles in the back of your upper arms, which aid in pushing movements) with just three exercises: dead-stop push-up, chest fly, and alternating chest press. Add these into your routine and you’ll gradually build up the strength you need to safely and effectively do a full push-up.
            </ul>

          <h5>2
            A 5-Move Bodyweight Chest and Shoulder Workout</h5>
          <p>
            <ul>
                This five-move bodyweight chest and shoulders workout, created by LIT Method cofounders Justin and Taylor Norris, centers on the push-up. <br>

                You’ll complete three different push-up variations during the main set of the workout, starting with the dive bomber push-up, a variation that trains flexibility in your lower half while helping you build pushing strength. Then you’ll take on the decline push-up, a progression from the regular push-up that works the front of your shoulders and is harder than the traditional one. You’ll finish with a wide-grip push-up, which really hits your serratus anterior, a muscle deep around the top of the ribcage that plays an important role in stabilizing your scapula. Trust us: This routine will smoke your pecs.
            </ul>

            <h5>3
                A Dumbbell Chest Workout That Will Also Smoke Your Abs</h5>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    This dumbbell chest workout delivers a one-two punch: serious chest strengthening plus stellar work on the abs. Created by Fagan, this five-move push-pull workout relies heavily on single-arm dumbbell moves, which helps make sure you’re working each side of your body equally. That’s important, as it can alleviate the muscle imbalances most of us have, Fagan explains. Single-arm work also really challenges your core stability, which turns these upper-body exercises into abs exercises too. Now that’s what we call a win-win.
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h5>4
                A Push-Pull Workout to Build Strength All Over</h5>
            <p>
               <ul>
                Okay, so this workout includes more than just pushing (the movement pattern which really fires up your chest muscles). It also hits your pulling muscles, which make it a really balanced way to approach a chest workout. <br>

                While you may think of a push-pull routine as just a chest and back workout, it can actually be a whole lot more. Take this this routine, where you’ll be alternating between moves that work your pushing and pulling muscles, for both your upper body and your lower body. So while this workout will really smoke your pectoral muscles and triceps with horizontal pushing motions, it’ll also work your lats, rhomboids, and biceps, along with your lower-body muscles like quads, hamstrings, and glutes. Created by Melissa Garcia, P.T., DPT, CSCS, a strength coach and physical therapist at Bespoke Treatments in Seattle, this workout is an awesome way to work your entire body.

                    If you want to challenge your chest and get a dose of core and other upper-body strength work, too, this workout is for you. Created as part of SELF’s 2021 Better Together Challenge, this eight-move routine combines chest-centric moves, like the push-up, with back moves and core moves for an intense, sweaty strength workout. <br>

                    Bonus: You don’t need any equipment to do this workout, making it an easy addition to your at-home exercise routine.
