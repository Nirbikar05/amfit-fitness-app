        <h1><b>What makes a good back workout?</b></h1>
        <p>A good back workout engages and strengthens the muscles in the back. Since the back is so big, some back workouts might specifically focus on the upper back or the lower back. Good back workouts combine large, compound movements that work multiple muscles at once—like rows—and isolation exercises that target specific muscles that help assist larger movements—like biceps curls.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p>
            For the most part, back exercises typically involve “pulling,” and chest workouts involve “pushing.” It’s important to balance the two so that you don’t end up tight in the front or back of your body. As SELF has previously reported, many people tend to neglect the back of the body and put a larger focus on movements that target front-of-the-body muscles, which is why many trainers recommend actually working your back muscles in a two-to-one ratio to your pushing muscles. The whole goal is to achieved balanced strength—which will help you feel good, sit up straighter, and avoid muscle imbalances that can ultimately lead to injury.

          <h5>1
            A Lower Back Workout to Strengthen Your Entire Core</h5>
          <p>
            The muscles in your lower back play an important role in overall core strength and stabilization as well as supporting your spine so that you can maintain an upright posture. And for many people who have lower-back pain or discomfort—which is a ton of us—the real culprit may actually be a lack of strength in your core, ACE-certified personal trainer Sivan Fagan, owner of Strong With Sivan in Baltimore, previously told SELF. <br>

            This lower back workout created by Fagan is full of compound exercises that will help build lower-back strength, including Romanian deadlifts and bear crawls. While these may not seem like overtly lower-back exercises, they work this important area in addition to engaging other key muscle groups—like the abdominals and glutes. Using compound movements is often the most functional way to weight train, since you use all of these muscles in tandem when you move through your daily life.

          <h5>2
            A Dumbbell Back Workout You Need If You’ve Been Sitting All Day</h5>
          <p>
            Chances are, your back muscles are underutilized. When we sit all day hunched over a desk with less-than-perfect posture, our shoulders tend to round forward, causing the front of the shoulders and chest muscles to shorten, and the back muscles to lengthen. When the back muscles are lengthened, they typically become weaker and less mobile. This sort of imbalance between the front and back of the body can lead to general tightness, stiffness, and even injury if not corrected. <br>

            This dumbbell workout seeks to correct all that by targeting the back muscles with three different row variations, plus rear-delt flys to hit the backs of the shoulders, and bicep curls to target the muscles which play a supporting role in all pulling motion.

                A 4-Move Upper-Body Kettlebell Workout to Strengthen Your Arms, Back, and Shoulders</h5>
            <p>
                If kettlebells are more your speed, try this kettlebell workout that hits all the major muscle groups in your upper body, including your back and shoulders. <br>

                Like all kettlebell workouts, you’ll also get in some core work and even a little cardio. Each move is a compound exercise, so your body has to use lots of energy—and rely on core stabilizing muscles—to get the work done properly.

            <h5>4
                A Resistance Band Back Workout That’ll Help You Stand Up Straight</h5>
            <p>
                A resistance band is one of the best types of equipment to use for back workouts. It’s easily portable and convenient, and allows you to perform “pulling” movements without having several sets of dumbbells at different weights. Bands also challenge your muscles in a slightly different way, since the resistance changes as you pull more or less on the band, and provides resistance during both phases (lifting and lowering) of an exercise. <br>

                This workout uses a resistance band to strengthen your back and shoulder muscles. You’ll work on skills like shoulder blade retraction (squeezing together) and protraction (moving apart) and gentle rotator cuff mobility and strength. You’ll also strengthen the pec muscles in your chest, plus your triceps, and stabilize every exercise using your core.

                A No-Equipment Back and Core Strength Workout</h5>
            <p>
                This back and core workout is part of our Better Together Challenge (which includes 20 workouts done over 4 weeks. Check out more of our fitness challenges here). But you can also add it to your regular workout routine. On its face, this workout looks like a pretty standard core workout, but there’s actually a lot of sneaky back-strengthening moves in here too. <br>

                With exercises like the plank to dolphin (shown above), you’ll engage your core, but also your lower back and even your shoulders as you work to stabilize your spine and keep your hips in a neutral position. The superman with pulldown also directly engages your back muscles, and acts as a great way to finish any abs workout. This workout also hits your trapezius, rotator cuff muscles (small muscles that stabilize the shoulder joint), your lats, and even your erector spinae—all without any equipment.
