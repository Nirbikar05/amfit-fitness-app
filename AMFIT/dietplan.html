      <p class="dietmsg col-md-6">All you need to do is start eating right food. However, in India, this can feel like
        an insurmountable challenge, given our food culture and dietary habits. For instance, a typical Indian meal is
        high in carbohydrates and sugar – we eat a lot of potatoes, rice, and sweets.

        We also love our snacks and can’t imagine a day without our fix of namkeens and bhujias. Even we encourage our
        friends and family into eating more, as a sign of hospitality and affection, and consider refusing, an extra
        helping a rebuff.

        To top it all, we’ve never embraced physical exercise as essential. So, it isn’t a surprise that India is
        battling with a growing problem of obesity.</p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Understand the Science Behind Weight Loss:</h2>
        <p class="dietmsg2">Weight loss and gain revolve around caloric consumption and expenditure. Simply put, you
          lose weight when you consume fewer calories than you expend and you gain weight when you consume more calories
          than you sweat.
          <br>
          To drop those extra kilos, all you need to do is eat within your calorie budget and burn the required number
          of calories. So, a combination of the two works best suggested experts.
          Get your daily requirement of calorie consumption and burn based on your lifestyle and dietary preferences
          However, simply determining how many calories your body needs isn’t enough. After all, four samosas (600
          calories), two slices of pizza (500 calories), and two gulab jamuns (385 calories) may be within your daily
          requirement of 1500 calories, but these unhealthy food choices will eventually lead to other health problems
          like high cholesterol and blood sugar.
          <br>
          To lose weight the healthy way, you also need to ensure your Indian diet plan is balanced i.e. it covers all
          food groups and provides all the nutrients you need necessary for good health.

        <h2 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">The Best Diet Plan for Weight Loss – Men and Women:</h2>
        <p class="dietmsg2">No single food provides all the calories and nutrients that the body needs to stay healthy.
          <br>
          That’s why a balanced diet consisting of macronutrients like carbohydrates, protein, and fat along with
          micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals, is recommended.
          <br>
          The best Indian diet for weight loss is a combination of the five major food groups – fruits and vegetables,
          cereals and pulses, meat and dairy products, and fats and oils. Furthermore, knowing how to divvy up the food
          groups, allocate portion sizes, and the best/ideal time to eat is also equally important.

        <p class="dietmsg2">A lot can be spoken about what goes into an ideal diet chart. However, one’s nutritional
          requirement varies based on various factors. It could change depending on gender, for example, male dietary
          requirements vary from that of a female.
          <br>
          Geography can play a role as well, with North Indian diets being largely different from South Indian ones. So,
          here meal preferences come into play since the consumption of food by a vegetarian or a vegan differ largely
          from that by a non-vegetarian.
          <br>
          However, we have put together a diet plan ideal for weight loss with Indian food. This 7 day diet plan also
          known as a 1200 calorie diet plan is a sample, and should not be followed by any individual without consulting
          a nutritionist.

      <p class="dietmsg2 col-md-6">The struggle of being underweight is as hard as being overweight. In addition, being
        underweight comes with its own set of health challenges, such as fatigue, weak immunity, frequent infections,
        fragile bones, pale skin, and brittle hair. Therefore, it is imperative to choose an efficient and healthy diet
        plan for weight gain.
        <br>
        There are two major nutritional factors that dictate the rate of muscular growth and fat loss in our bodies.
        These are calories and macronutrients. Thus, these two influencers should be kept under consideration when
        selecting the foods to be incorporated into your weight gain diet.
        <br>
        When muscle building is the aim, additional calories are needed. Being in a calorie surplus over a period of
        time in combination with strength training will result in significant muscular hypertrophy (growth). Gaining
        muscle requires consistency in terms of dietary choices and activity levels. Fortunately enough, just as there
        are diet plans to lose weight, there are diet plans for weight gain.
        <br>

        alt="">
      <p class="dietmsg2">
        A diet plan for weight gain focuses on high-calorie and good-quality protein and healthy fat intake. A proper
        diet plan for weight gain provides you with essential nutrients while helping you build muscle mass.
        <br>
        If you are struggling to find the perfect diet plan to gain weight, then you have come to the right place. This
        article covers all aspects of a good diet plan that will help you gain weight.

    <div class="row">
      <h3 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">What is a Healthy Weight Range?</h3>
      <p class="dietmsg2">
        Your Body Mass Index (BMI) determines your healthy weight range. To calculate your BMI, divide your body weight
        by your height in a meter square. The answer you get is your BMI.
        <br>
      </p>
      <h3 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Potential Causes Of Being Underweight</h3>
      <h4 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">1. High Metabolism</h4>
      <p class="dietmsg2">
        The process by which food gets converted into energy is called metabolism. Metabolism greatly impacts how many
        calories the body burns and the higher the metabolism, more is the more calorie burn. High metabolism can also
        be genetic.
        <br>
        The higher the metabolic rate, the lesser the weight gain. It is to say that people with a high metabolic rate
        remain lean and find it difficult to gain weight.
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">2. Family History </h4>
      <p class="dietmsg2">
        Our genes play a significant role in deciding our body structure and weight.
        <br>
        If you have a low BMI and a lean body genetically, it will affect your weight. The genes also play a role in
        determining the rate of metabolism. As a result, the BMR rates differ between families.
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">3. Physical Disorders</h4>
      <p class="dietmsg2">
        Regular nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are common symptoms of various diseases, making it difficult for the
        suffering individual to gain weight.
        <br>
        Other conditions may decrease a person’s appetite, so they do not feel like eating. Examples include cancer,
        diabetes, thyroid disorders, and digestive conditions, such as Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis.
        <br>
        Certain medications that treat these illnesses may also suppress appetite or affect the taste that causes one
        reluctance towards food. Furthermore, some disorders like that of the thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism/
        hypothyroidism) directly affect weight management.
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">4. Mental Illness</h4>
      <p class="dietmsg2">
        Poor mental health can affect a person’s ability to eat. Conditions like depression, anxiety,
        obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia can affect a person’s
        body image and appetite.
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">5. Chronic Stress</h4>
      <p class="dietmsg2">
        The recognition that stress can cause serious diseases has been a hot topic for research since it affects weight
        at multiple levels. While stress causes headaches, poor diet, and disturbances in sleep cycles in many people,
        it has worse consequences such as unexplained weight loss.
        <br>
        Your body prepares for an ‘acute stress response’ by generating hormones like adrenaline. According to research,
        adrenaline can reduce your urge to eat while simultaneously preparing your body for strenuous activity. It is
        due to the neurological system telling the adrenal glands above the kidneys to initiate a “fight-or-flight”
        response.
        <br>
        This heightened mental state momentarily suppresses appetite. But this adrenaline rush doesn’t last long, and
        soon after, you’ll feel tired, and the same vicious cycle continues.
        <br>
        Stress alters your metabolism, which results in weight loss. In addition, it interferes with the brain’s ability
        to communicate with the gastrointestinal (GI) system, which makes GI symptoms more noticeable.
        <br>
        Many GI symptoms, including nausea, gas, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, bloating, and difficulty swallowing, can be
        brought on by stress. These signs may influence a person’s eating patterns, resulting in weight loss.
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">6. Enzyme deficiency</h4>
      <p class="dietmsg2">
        Deficiencies of digestive enzymes and/or stomach acids may also hamper digestion and absorption of food thus
        causing weight loss.
        <br>
      </p>
      <h3 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Weight Gain Diet Tips for Healthy Weight:</h3>
      <h4 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">1. Consume High-Calorie Food</h4>
      <p class="dietmsg2">A calorie-rich diet is necessary to gain the right amount of weight according to your body
        type. A nutritionist can help you determine how many calories you should consume daily based on age, gender,
        metabolism, body composition, and physical activity. <br>

        Consuming fewer calories than you burn will result in weight loss, so if you’re looking to gain weight or build
        muscle, you may need to increase your daily calorie intake by 500 or more.

        <br> An average person gains 1-2 pounds kg body weight every week by increasing 500 to 1000 calories daily.
        However, the type of weight acquired (fat or muscle) depends on the exercise regime and the intake of
        macronutrients.

        <br> Nuts and seeds contain polyunsaturated fats that add healthy calories to your diet. Pistachios, almonds,
        walnuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, and pumpkin seeds are some great options for you. If you’re not
        keen on snacking on nuts, you can pack in extra calories with nut butter.

        <br> One tablespoon of peanut butter, for example, has about 95 calories as per USDA. Some more nutritious
        high-calorie food that you may include in your diet are homemade granola bars, tofu, avocados, chickpeas, etc.
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">2. Consume Healthy Carbs</h4>
      <p class="dietmsg2">Carbohydrates are among the most misunderstood nutrients. Though it is true that excess
        consumption of carbohydrates leads to a higher fat content in the body. However, if consumed in regulated
        quantities, the benefits to be reaped from carbohydrates are also significant.

        <br> They are considered fuel for metabolism and are the major energy-providing foods. Carbohydrates provide
        constant energy to the body for those involved in regular physical activity.

        <br> It is a must that you include healthy carbohydrates in your diet while discontinuing the consumption of
        high-sugar foods and refined grains.
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">3. Have Protein-Rich Diet</h4>
      <p class="dietmsg2">Protein deficiency can make you lose muscle mass and which in turn slows down metabolism. Take
        at least 1.5-2 grams of protein per kg of your body weight to gain weight and build lean muscle mass. <br>

        A recent study found that a high-protein diet can lead to increased muscle mass. People whose diet consists of
        more than 20% protein, particularly animal protein, are more likely to gain more than those with 10% protein.
        Chicken breast, turkey, nuts, legumes, beans, fish, eggs, and milk are excellent sources of lean proteins.
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">4. Reduce Stress</h4>
      <p class="dietmsg2">Weight loss associated with stress is common, whether it be from skipping meals, experiencing
        digestive problems, or engaging in intense exercise as a coping method.
        <br>
        There are several self-help methods you can do to reduce stress. You may prevent stress-related weight loss by
        developing a support network, learning to handle stress through meditation, and making sure you routinely eat
        nourishing meals. You should see a doctor if you cannot manage stress, or encounter persistent, unintentional
        weight loss.
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">5. Strength Training</h4>
      <p class="dietmsg2">Strength training is an excellent way to target numerous muscle groups and increase their
        strength. Adding additional workouts and weights to your schedule will help you gain lean muscle mass. <br>

        It is recommended that you work with a fitness coach to start a strength training plan tailor-made just for you.
        The right set of exercises can keep your body toned and defined. Pushups, lunges and squats are some of the
        exercises that you can include in your workout.
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">6. Get Good Sleep</h4>
      <p class="dietmsg2">People often give all the needed attention and more to a proper diet and workout, while
        ignoring the fact that getting the required amount of sleep is equally important.

        <br> Ghrelin and leptin are two hormones that shape our appetite and hunger signals. Ghrelin is the ‘hunger’
        hormone that tells you when to eat, while leptin gives the feeling of fullness.

        <br> Sleep deprivation alters the circadian rhythm of the body thereby causing a disbalance of these hormones
        which directly impacts your appetite.

        <br> One may indulge in binge eating during night or may not get hungry at all. Not having a proper diet will
        lead to fatigue and exhaustion resulting in an inability to perform any physical activity for weight management.
